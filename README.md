Hello and welcome to my final project for the 12th Automation QA with Java course of Skillo Academy! :blush: :sparkler:

We were given the opportunity to create and execute various tests for the iSkillo platform, based on TestNG and Selenium WebDriver technologies, using Google Chrome browser. :rocket:
My Java Maven project follows Page Object Model design pattern and PageFactory and includes 5 test scenarios: 

1. Login (with existing user)
2. Logout
3. Click Like button
4. Search for user
5. Registration of new user

and, in case a given test fails, it saves a screenshot. :camera_flash:
The project contains testng.xml file and by executing a "mvn clean test" command, a surefire report is generated. :bookmark_tabs:

Thank you for being here, have a nice day and happy coding! :raised_hands:
